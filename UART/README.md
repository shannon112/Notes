# Intro:
The **Inter-Integrated Circuit** (I2C, pronounced I-squared-C) is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. Alternatively, I2C is spelled I2C (pronounced I-two-C) or IIC (pronounced I-I-C). Typical applications include GY series IMU and RTC clock module.[1]
applications: serial (COM) port, RS-232, modems

# Character:
- **Serial communication bus**, with contrary to Parallel
- **Master-Slave-Based**, multi-master, multi-slave.
- **Can be Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex communication**, one line TX->RX data send in one direction, 2 lines data send in each direction but only one at a time, 2 lines data send in both directions simultaneously .
- **Asynchronous communication**, no clock mechanism, the transmitter and receiver must at the same speed (baud rate) and frame structure.
- **Transmitted as frames**, 

# Interface:
- **TX**：Serial Data 串列資料. Transmits data from the master to the slave or slave to the master.  
- **RX**：Serial Clock 串列時脈. Synchronize the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus and it’s generated by the master device.

# Speed (baud rate)
9600
19200
57600
115200

# Frame
- Start bit: from high to low
- Stop bit: stay or return to high
- Data bits: 5~9bits (usually 7 or 8 bits) and LSB first
- Parity bit: used for error detection. Even parity or odd
high voltage (marked), low voltage (space)
idle is held high

# Data Transmission

# Pros and cons 
- Advantages  
  - low cost, and easy construct for low speed, low throughput application
- Disadvantages [1]

```c
```
- GY-80 consists 5 different sensors and the GY-521 consists 3 different sensors. But there are only 5 device address.

# LSB first v.s. MSB first
Data: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1

LSB (first) order: 1 1 0 0 1 0 1  
MSB (first) order: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
