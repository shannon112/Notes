# Intro:
The **Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter** (UART, pronounced U-ART) is an asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. It sends data bits one by one, from the least significant to the most significant, framed by start and stop bits so that precise timing is handled by the communication channel. It was one of the earliest computer communication devices, used to attach teletypewriters for an operator console. It was also an early hardware system for the Internet. The electric signaling levels are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART. Two common signal levels are RS-232, a 12-volt system, and RS-485, a 5-volt system. Specialised UARTs are used for automobiles, smart cards and SIMs. Early teletypewriters used current loops. A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. One or more UART peripherals are commonly integrated in microcontroller chips.[1]
applications: serial (COM) port, RS-232, modems

# Character:
- **Serial communication bus**, with contrary to Parallel
- **Master-Slave-Based**, multi-master, multi-slave.
- **Can be Simplex, Half-Duplex, Full-Duplex communication**, one line TX->RX data send in one direction, 2 lines data send in each direction but only one at a time, 2 lines data send in both directions simultaneously .
- **Asynchronous communication**, no clock mechanism, the transmitter and receiver must at the same speed (baud rate) and frame structure.
- **Transmitted as frames**, 

# Interface:
- **TX**：Serial Data 串列資料. Transmits data from the master to the slave or slave to the master.  
- **RX**：Serial Clock 串列時脈. Synchronize the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus and it’s generated by the master device.

# Speed (baud rate)
9600
19200
57600
115200

# Frame
- Start bit: from high to low
- Stop bit: stay or return to high. can have 1 or 2 stop bit
- Data bits: 5~9bits (usually 7 or 8 bits) and LSB first
- Parity bit: used for error detection. Even parity or odd
high voltage (marked), low voltage (space)
idle is held high

# Data Transmission
Setting: 
speed baud rate, 4800, 9600, 
parity, None, even, odd, mark, space
data bits, 5 6 7 8
stopbits, 1, 2
e.g. 9600 8N1 for speed=9600, databits=8, parity=none, stopbits=1

# Pros and cons 
- Advantages  
  - low cost, and easy construct for low speed, low throughput application
- Disadvantages [1]

```c
int value = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    value = Serial.read();
    delay(5);

    if (value == '1') {
      digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
      Serial.println("LED is ON");
    }

    if (value == '0') {
      digitalWrite(led, LOW);
      Serial.println("LED is OFF");
    }
  }
}

- Arduino usb port to PC is a uart serial (COM) port, shown as /dev/cu.usbserial-1410
- Open the arduino serial monitor on PC and choose the correct frame format, then can send data through uart to arduino

# LSB first v.s. MSB first
Data: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1  
     MSB         LSB  
LSB (first) order: 1 1 0 0 1 0 1  
MSB (first) order: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1
